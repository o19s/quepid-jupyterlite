# Welcome to Quepid's Notebooks!   

The example notebooks are stored under ./examples.  Feel free to run them, but please save your notebooks in another directory as we roll new notebooks out over time, under the ./examples directory.

## What Notebooks Are available?

* `./examples/Scoring Comparison.ipynb` is an example of measuring relevance score change.
* `./examples/Jaccard and RBO Comparison.ipynb` is an example of comparing query result sets to each other.

* `./examples/Multiple Raters Analysis.ipynb` looks at how judge compare in rating.
* `./examples/Fleiss Kappa.ipynb` calculates a specific measurement of rater agreement.

These notebooks use data from the Haystack Rating Party.
